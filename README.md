## Numerosity Perception VAE ##
beta-Variational AutoEncoder architectures for numerosity perception modeling through the datset described in "*Visual sense of number vs. sense of magnitude in humans and machines*"
(Testolin, A., Dolfi, S., Rochus, M., & Zorzi, M., 2020)

- The main code is in the file *main.py*, that contains the training testing and analysis of the model investigated;

- The directory *utils* contains the functions used in main.py;

- The directory *dataset* contains the original .mat dataset preprocessed and used during the training and testing;

- Finally, the directory *net_params* is an empty folder. During the training of each model in different conditions, a new directory is created that contains plots, model's parameters and a txt file with the parameters dictionary used during training
